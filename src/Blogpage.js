      The term "Ayurveda" is derived from two Sanskrit words: "Ayur," meaning
      life, and "Veda," meaning knowledge or science. Together, they signify the
      comprehensive knowledge of life and its various aspects. Ayurveda
      encompasses not only the physical health of an individual but also their
      mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being.

      "Understanding Ayurveda: The Science of Life" Ayurveda, often referred to
      as the "Science of Life" or "Knowledge of Life," is an ancient system of
      medicine with roots that extend back over five millennia. This holistic
      approach to health and well-being originated in the Indian subcontinent
      and has since captivated people worldwide with its profound wisdom.

    <h2 className="principle">PRINCIPALS OF AYURVEDA</h2>
    <p className="para2">
      The Three Doshas: At the core of Ayurveda are the principles of the three
      doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas represent combinations of the
      five fundamental elements—earth, water, fire, air, and ether—and determine
      an individual's constitution and unique characteristics. The Role of
      Balance in Ayurveda: Central to Ayurveda is the concept of balance. Health
      is seen as a state of equilibrium among the doshas, while disease arises
      from imbalances. Ayurvedic practices and treatments aim to restore and
      maintain this delicate balance, promoting vitality and well-being.
